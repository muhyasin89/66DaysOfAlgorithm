===========================
what the problem?       |||
===========================

We need to put number inside linkedlist
    ========================
    Sample Input        |||
    ========================
    3
    16
    13
    7
    1
    2

    ========================
    Sample Output        |||
    ========================
    16 13 1 7

    ========================
    Explanation
    ========================
    The initial linked list is 16 > 13 > 7 . 

    Insert  1 at the position  2 which currently has & in it. 

    The updated linked list is 16 -> 13 -> 1 -> 7

==============================
IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAIL?
==============================
insertNodeAtPosition has the following parameters:

head: a SinglyLinkedListNode pointer to the head of the list
data: an integer value to insert as data in your new node
position: an integer position to insert the new node, zero based indexing
Returns

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the revised list

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next n lines contains an integer SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data.
The next line contains an integer data, the data of the node that is to be inserted.
The last line contains an integer position.

==============================
WHAT IS NOT COMPLETE OR CLEAR
==============================

from explenation  from where it has input 1 and its position 2 is not clear.

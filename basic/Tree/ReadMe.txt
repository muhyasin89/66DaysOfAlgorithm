what is Tree?      |||
===========================
A tree is a Hierarchical data structure that naturally hierarchically stores the information. The Tree data structure is one of the most efficient and mature. The nodes connected by the edges are represented

### Types of Trees in Data Structure
1. General Tree
2. Binary Tree
3. Binary Search Tree
4. AVL Tree (not included)
5. Red-Black Tree (not included)
6. N-ary Tree (not included)

===========================
why we do need a Tree?|
===========================
* The tree reflects the data structural connections.
* The tree is used for hierarchy.
* It offers an efficient search and insertion procedure.
* The trees are flexible. This allows subtrees to be relocated with minimal effort.

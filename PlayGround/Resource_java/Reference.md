## Key Differences between Map and HashMap

- The Map is an interface, and HashMap is a class of the Java collection framework.
- The Map interface can be implemented by using its implementing classes. In comparison, the HashMap class implements the Map interface.
- The Map contains unique key-pair values. But, the HashMap can hold duplicate values.
- The Map does not allow null values. But the HashMap can have one null key and multiple values.
- The Map has two implementations, which are HashMap and TreeMap. Whereas HashMap implements Map interface and extends AbstractMap class.
- There is no difference between the Map and HashMap objects

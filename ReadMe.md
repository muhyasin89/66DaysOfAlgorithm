  - BFS
    - Queue => FIFO
    - Stack => LIFO
    - LeastCost

Note:

- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.

for answering problem there is several things to consider
use this format bellow

optimalization problem:

1. Greedy Method
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Branch and Bound

Greedy Method - has pre condition
example :

- shortest method
- least cost

Dynamic programming - find all possible solution and find the best

Dyanamic programming using principle of optimality
principle of optimality is the problem can be solve by taking seek and solve decision

what is optimazation problem?

Problem that required minimum result or maximum result

Fesiable solution:
solution that statisfy the condition of problem

Optimal solution:
achieve the objective as problem

c_road = 2
c_lib = 3
cities = [[1,7], [1,3],[1,2],[2,3],[5,6],[6,8]]

Complete the function roadsAndLibraries in the editor below.
roadsAndLibraries has the following parameters:

- int n: integer, the number of cities
- int c_lib: integer, the cost to build a library
- int c_road: integer, the cost to repair a road
- int cities[m][2]: each cities[i] contains two integers that represent cities that can be connected by a new road

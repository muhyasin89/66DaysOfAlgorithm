step by step for solving this problem?|
========================================

1. Consider city 1 as the starting and ending point.
2. Generate all (n-1)! Permutations of cities.
3. Calculate cost of every permutation and keep track of minimum cost permutation.
4. Return the permutation with minimum cost.

========================================
Result Explanation?|
========================================
TSP tour in the graph is 1-2-4-3-1. The cost of the tour is 10+25+30+15 which is 80

What is bitmasking?
A bit mask (or Bitmap) is a data structure, usually an integer or array of bits, that represent a bit pattern which signifies a particular state in a particular computational problem. It takes advantage of bitwise operations.

Why we use bit mask?

- it is memory efficient in most problems

- it is computational efficient as we can use bitwise operations which are natively supported by the computer system and will be faster than other operations like addition (+).
